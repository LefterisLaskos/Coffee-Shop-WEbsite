            <h5>Coffee Shelter</h5>
            <p>I was in school in Crete, we spent a lot of time in coffee shops — studying, hanging out, meeting new friends. There was one coffee shop downtown with good food, a great atmosphere to study, a big screen for watching movies and even some games to help us de-stress before a big midterm. It became a networking hub for a number of us, as we spent time planning the night’s events.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Coffee shops like these were the perfect place to be productive, hang out, or just get some personal time away from the distractions of school. They made studying feel more like hanging out. We are building a professional atmosphere at The Coffee Shelter that makes working feel like hanging out.</p>
